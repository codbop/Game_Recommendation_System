# Steam_Game_Recommendation_System

In recent years the video game industry has become one of the most valuable industries in the world. One of the biggest reasons for this success is diversity. Multiple platforms dedicated to games provide this diversity, with an enormous number of genres and categories of games available. For one of these platforms, Steam, more than 10 million users connect to the server every hour. With this comes needs for users that need to be met. One of the main ones is to be able to offer the right option to the relevant user among so much diversity.	

Nowadays, platforms that sell games (steam, etc.) recommend various games to users in order to attract more users. Therefore, recommendation systems have an important place in these platforms.

At this point, we are developing a system that makes recommendations for a single user on Steam similar to the games they have played before. Based on the playing time of the user, we present games in similar categories to the user based on the games in which category the user has played the most.
